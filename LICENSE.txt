The above license and copyright applies to the source code only, not to the 
output of the code. The code defines a 3D "virtual object" (mathematical 
implicit surface, with color defined at each point on the surface). The intent 
is that this virtual object should be closely similar to the "Spot" model, 
which was created by Keenan Crane and released into the public domain (defined 
by Catmull-Clark control points and an SVG file). The virtual object defined by 
the code is a modification of that original creative work and is also hereby 
released into the public domain. This virtual object (whether rendered as a 
static or moving image, or output as data such as a mesh, point cloud, or 
texture) may be incorporated into new creative works (including works with a 
different license or copyright) without restriction.

The original Spot model can be found here:

Keenan Crane has stated that acknowledgement is appreciated but not required.
